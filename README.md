# About the Game
Solitaire is a single player with many variations. This flavor of solitaire is Klondike, where the goal is to arrange the cards into four piles from Ace to King using a standard 52 card deck of playing cards.

# How to Play the Game
There are four main section sections to the board.
## 1. The Foundation
This where you cards are sorted. The foundation piles start with the ace. Your cards will be place here sequentially in the same suit. The game is won when all of your cards are in the foundation.
## 2. The Tableau
In the tableau you can only place a card whose rank is one lower than that card is being place on top of and of an alternate color.
## 3. The Hand
This is where you will draw from to get more cards to make more moves. This version of the game deals 1 card at a time from the hand. The drawn cards goes into the waste pile. Once the hand is empty turn the waste pile over and at it to the hand.
## 4. The Waste
The waste is where your drawn cards go. Turn over the card you pull from the hand and stack them on top of each other. You can only access the top most card on the waste.
